    <h2>About</h2>
    <img src="../images/me.jpg" alt="me" class="images" />
    <p>My name is Correy Justyn Winke.  I am eighteen years old, and I will be graduating from George S. Parker High School in June of 2014.  I have been driven to perform to the best of my abilities throughout my education despite being dyslexic and having hypothyroidism.  </p>
<p>
Through determination and hard work I have been able to achieve significant educational milestones.  I am proud that I have been able to receive an Honors award for my last three years at Parker.  To be eligible for the Honors award, a student must have a grade point average of 3.5 or above.  My class rank at the end of my junior year was 45 out of 319 students.  This translates to the top 15% of my graduating class.  As a reward for my academic success I was given the honor to represent Parker High School as one of the three Badger Boys State delegates following completion of my junior year.   During my junior year, I was also honored to be a presenter at the national SETDA convention.  SETDA is an organization that deals with the use of assistive technology by students.  Assistive technology is very important to me.  It allows me to achieve and compete with students that do not have barriers to their education.  I have maintained a high standard for my education.  Throughout my high school years, I have or will be taking a total of seven honors and advanced placement courses.  I am additionally proud of the fact that even though I qualify, I am not currently taking any adapted courses for my learning disabilities.
</p><p>
My education is very important and demanding of my non-school hours, but I do realize that it also important to be part of the community.  Being part of the community, not only helps those that I am assisting either now or in the future, but it helps me to be a better person and see myself as part of the whole.   I have over the last four years spent my summers assisting the Badger Chordhawks and the Tuesday Morning Optimist with various volunteer activities.  I have helped my uncles on their dairy farms each of the last four summers.   I have been an active member of the Kids against Tobacco Use organization for six years; the Kiwanis KEY club for four years; the bowling club for four years; Japanese, computer, Japanese anime and recycling clubs for one year each.    I also have been taking private guitar lessons for five years.  Each of these activities has not only helped those who I have assisted or will assist in the future, but has helped me to become a better student of life and my education.

If I should be fortunate enough to receive a scholarship, it will be a great start in paying for my education at Madison Media Institute.  My goal is to complete their Mobile Application Development degree.  I plan to use my degree to build mobile applications that are not only useful for each person but are also sensitive to the needs of a person with disabilities.
</p><p>
I would like to thank you for your consideration.  I assure you that if I am chosen, that I will use your generous gift to help not only myself but all those that I will help throughout my career.
